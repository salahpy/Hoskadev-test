Features
Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Navigation Menu: The navigation bar includes dynamic items that allow users to easily navigate through the sections of the website, such as the homepage, course details, and more. The navigation is sleek and responsive, adjusting based on the screen size.

Animated UI Elements: The site features several animations that enhance the user experience. Elements such as buttons, images, and text animate on hover, providing engaging transitions. We used Framer Motion for smooth animations.

Hero Section: The hero section includes a dynamically updating course display. When a user clicks on "More Details", the content of the hero changes to reflect the specific course's details, offering an interactive and engaging experience.

Course Details: Each course has its own detailed page, including the course description, original price, discounted price, and course level. The user can see additional details like the start date, course language, and duration.

Dynamic Data Fetching: The course data is fetched from an API and displayed dynamically. This includes all relevant information about the course, including ratings, duration, and more. The hero section updates with the selected course when "More Details" is clicked.

Interactive Elements: Interactive buttons for registering, saving courses, and switching between groups are available. Hover and tap effects add to the engagement.

Group Availability: The "Available Groups" section displays available course groups, including the members of each group, time remaining for registration, and the groupâ€™s capacity. Users can reserve spots within a group by clicking the "Book Now" button.
